# Preprocessor Remodel Progress

## Summary
We've successfully implemented Phase 1 of the preprocessor remodeling plan and made significant progress on eliminating the known limitations.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: External Scanner Infrastructure ✅
1. **Created src/scanner.c** - External scanner with preprocessor state tracking
2. **Updated grammar.js** - Added externals array with synthetic tokens
3. **Updated build files** - Modified binding.gyp and bindings/rust/build.rs
4. **Implemented basic detection** - Scanner detects preprocessor directives

### Fixed Limitations (2 of 6)
1. **✅ Pragmas before namespace** - Grammar now allows pragmas at file start
2. **✅ Conditional object declarations** - Added `preproc_conditional_object_declaration` rule

## Remaining Limitations (4)

### 1. Split Procedure Headers (2 variants)
- Test 321: Preprocessor splitting old vs new return syntax
- Test 534: Similar pattern with different structure
- **Challenge**: Need more sophisticated scanner logic to inject split markers

### 2. Mixed Var/Procedure Sections
- Test 320: Var declarations and procedures in same preprocessor block
- **Challenge**: Grammar expects clear separation between sections

### 3. Complex Trigger Preprocessor
- Test 322: Var declarations inside triggers with preprocessor
- **Challenge**: Nested preprocessor within trigger context

## Technical Insights

### What Works
- External scanner successfully tracks preprocessor state
- Grammar modifications allow new patterns without breaking existing code
- Synthetic tokens concept is viable but needs refinement

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Scanner Split Detection**: Current implementation is too simplistic
   - Need context-aware lookahead
   - Must track parser state to detect split points

2. **Grammar Flexibility**: Some rules are too rigid
   - Need more conditional variants of core constructs
   - Consider GLR parsing for ambiguous cases

3. **Test Expectations**: Some tests have conflicting expectations
   - Different tests expect different parse tree structures
   - Need to standardize approach

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Phase 2)
1. Enhance scanner split detection logic
2. Add `preproc_split_procedure` rule matching test expectations
3. Handle mixed var/procedure sections

### Medium Term (Phase 3)
1. Implement full context tracking in scanner
2. Add synthetic token injection for split constructs
3. Handle nested preprocessor in triggers

### Long Term (Phase 4)
1. Consider GLR parser mode for ambiguities
2. Add preprocessing transform option
3. Performance optimization

## Metrics
- **Tests Fixed**: 2 of 6 (33%)
- **Total Tests**: 851 (847 passing, 4 failing)
- **Success Rate**: 99.5% (up from 99.1%)
- **Code Added**: ~400 lines (scanner.c + grammar modifications)
