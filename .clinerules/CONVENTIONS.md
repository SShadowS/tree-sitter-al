**Best Practices for Creating a Tree-sitter Grammar for AL (Business Central)**

1. **Understand AL Language**
   - Study the AL syntax and unique constructs (object types, extensions, events).
   - Identify all keywords, operators, and language features.

2. **Follow Tree-sitter Conventions**
   - Define grammar rules in `grammar.js` using combinators like `seq`, `choice`, `optional`.
   - Use clear, descriptive, and consistent snake_case naming for rules.

3. **Maintain Clarity and Consistency**
   - Keep rule definitions simple and readable.
   - Comment complex or non-obvious rules for future reference.

4. **Handle Operator Precedence**
   - Explicitly define operator precedence and associativity using `prec.left`, `prec.right`, or `prec`.

5. **Avoid Ambiguities and Left Recursion**
   - Refactor left-recursive rules, as Tree-sitter doesn't support them.
   - Design the grammar to minimize ambiguities and conflicts.
   - Use `conflict` to resolve ambiguities when necessary, but prefer refactoring the grammar to eliminate conflicts.

6. **Implement Error Recovery**
   - Use error tokens and recovery strategies to handle syntax errors gracefully.
   - Ensure the parser can continue after encountering errors.

7. **Leverage Existing Grammars**
   - Reference Tree-sitter grammars for similar languages (e.g., Pascal, C#).
   - Reuse common patterns and adapt them to AL.

8. **Incremental Testing**
   - Continuously test the grammar with real AL code snippets.
   - Utilize Tree-sitter CLI tools for parsing and debugging.
   - Use `tree-sitter test` to run unit tests on the grammar.
   - Create a suite of test cases covering various language constructs.

9. **Optimize Performance**
   - Write efficient and concise rule definitions.
   - Minimize unnecessary lookahead and backtracking.

10. **Document Your Grammar**
    - Provide clear documentation and examples.
    - Include test cases covering various language features.

11. **Stay Updated with AL Changes**
    - Monitor updates to the AL language.
    - Update the grammar to maintain compatibility.

**Additional Tips**

- **Use Aliases**: Assign meaningful names to complex patterns using `alias`.
- **Modularity**: Break the grammar into manageable sections or modules.
- **Test Error Conditions**: Include tests for incorrect syntax to improve error handling.
