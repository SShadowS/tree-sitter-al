Complex ColumnFilter expressions in query columns (known limitation)

query 76 "Posted Docs With No Inc Doc"
{
    elements
    {
        dataitem(Incoming_Document; "Incoming Document")
        {
            column(NoOfIncomingDocuments)
            {
                // This pattern is not currently supported
                ColumnFilter = NoOfIncomingDocuments = const(0);
                Method = Count;
            }
        }
    }
}

Note: ColumnFilter with complex filter expressions (field = const(value)) is
currently parsed as a generic property but fails because generic properties
only accept simple values. This would require enhancing the generic_property
rule to handle complex expressions or creating a specialized parser for
filter expressions in query columns.
