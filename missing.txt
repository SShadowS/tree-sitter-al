TestPermissions type needs to be defined. It's an enum used in the OnAfterTestRun and OnBeforeTestRun triggers with the following possible values:
- Disabled
- Restrictive
- NonRestrictive
- InheritFromTestCodunit

We should add a rule for TestPermissions in the grammar.js file, defining it as an enum with these values.
