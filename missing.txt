TestPermissions type needs to be defined. It's an enum used in the OnAfterTestRun and OnBeforeTestRun triggers with the following possible values:
- Disabled
- Restrictive
- NonRestrictive
- InheritFromTestCodunit

We should add a rule for TestPermissions in the grammar.js file, defining it as an enum with these values.

Subtype property needs to be defined for codeunits. It's used to specify the type of codeunit, such as "Install" for installation codeunits or "Upgrade" for upgrade codeunits. We should add a rule in the grammar.js file to handle the Subtype property, especially for the OnInstallAppPerCompany, OnInstallAppPerDatabase, OnUpgradePerCompany, OnUpgradePerDatabase, and OnValidateUpgradePerDatabase triggers.

The OnDelete trigger for tables has been added to the grammar.js file. No additional items need to be added to the missing.txt file for this trigger.

Action type needs to be defined. It's used in the OnQueryClosePage trigger for pages. Action is likely an enum or a specific type in AL that represents the action taken to close a page (e.g., OK, Cancel). We should add a rule in the grammar.js file to define the Action type.

Interface object needs to be defined. It's mentioned in the Access property documentation as one of the object types that can use this property. We should add rules in the grammar.js file to define the interface object and its elements.

QueryType property needs to be defined for queries. It's used to specify the type of query, such as "API" for API queries. We should add a rule in the grammar.js file to handle the QueryType property, especially for API queries that use the APIGroup property.

The APIVersion property for queries has been updated in the grammar.js file. It now includes a comment mentioning that the default value is 'beta' if not specified. The QueryType property should be implemented to fully support the APIVersion property's functionality.

XMLport Table Element needs to be defined. It's used in the AutoUpdate, AutoReplace, and AutoSave properties for XMLports. We should add rules in the grammar.js file to define the XMLport Table Element and its structure.

Page Field needs to be defined. It's used in the BlankNumbers and BlankZero properties. We should add rules in the grammar.js file to define the Page Field and its structure.
